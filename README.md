# hello-world
Ideas, resources &amp; things to discuss.
I am a 1st year BaElectrical Engineering student at Vic Uni learning how to code. 
I also have a business called MY BOOK CLUB which is a digital book club dedicated to personal development and connection in a crazy world. 
Currently looking for a junior developer to help us continue building our platform.
